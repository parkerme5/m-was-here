        <h1>Collage Evolution</h1>

        <img src="tv viewers collage for website.jpg" alt="Digital surrealist collage image using vintage black and white photos. Two large people, one in a dress and the other in a suit, stand over a crowd of smaller people with thier backs to the viewer. The large people have tv's in place of thier heads. Inside one of the tv heads is another separate image of children watching tv. An interjecting hand holding a remote control occupies the right bottom corner. ">

        <h2> What defines a collage?</h2>

        <p>A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collage">collage</a> is a work of art created through the act of combining a variety of objects, images, or materials. It involves the purposful shifting of several elements into something entirely new or unexpected. For me, collage is mainly about the collection of older images and how I can transform the past into a present form. </p>

        <p>There are many types of collages, but there are a few I focus on:</p>
            <li>Digital Collage</li>
            <li>Paper/Magazine Collage</li>
            <li>Collage Film</li>
