        <p>Tomorrow when the farm boys find this
            freak of nature, they will wrap his body
            in newspaper and carry him to the museum.
            But tonight he is alive and in the north
            field with his mother. It is a perfect
            summer evening: the moon rising over
            the orchard, the wind in the grass. And
            as he stares into the sky, there are
            twice as many stars as usual.</p>
